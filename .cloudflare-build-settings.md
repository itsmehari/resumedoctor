# Cloudflare Workers Build Settings

**You must change these in the Cloudflare dashboard** – Workers Builds does not read wrangler config for build/deploy commands.

## Required settings

Go to **Workers & Pages** → your **resumedoctor** project → **Settings** → **Build**.

| Setting | Change to |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build command** | `npm run build:cloudflare` |
| **Deploy command** | `npx wrangler deploy` |

Or alternatively, use the combined deploy script:

| Setting | Change to |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build command** | `true` *(or leave empty if allowed)* |
| **Deploy command** | `npm run deploy` |

The `npm run deploy` script runs OpenNext build + deploy in one step.
